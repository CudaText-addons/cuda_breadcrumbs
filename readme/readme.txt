Plugin for CudaText.
Shows the toolbar widget (modern name is breadcrumb bar) below or on top of the editor for quick
file-system navigation. For example, when you have active editor with filename
"~/mydir/myfile.ext" ("~" is Unix shortcut for "/home/user"), the widget shows buttons:
[ home > user > mydir > myfile.ext ]
It can also show the "~" button (by option):
[ ~ > mydir > myfile.ext ]

Clicking on each button shows the popup with file-system listing, showing the
folder containing  the clicked item. This popup supports basic tree-view navigation,
you can click files there to open them in CudaText.

Plugin can also show buttons for Code-Tree nodes. This must be enabled first
in the config file - turn on the option "code_navigation".
Clicking the buttons from the code-tree shows the same tree-popup but with
a different content - with symbols of the documents. Clicking the nodes
in the tree-popup scrolls the document to different symbols.
